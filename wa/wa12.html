<!--To extend my quote machine, which in this case, I did an image machine of different dogs,
I decided to add a new input button where you can search for a specific dog. I went on  
the website I got the random dog API pictures and then I found a link to dogs listed by breed. 
To do this, I copied the code I used for the first button, but had to make this link a string that went through the link,
Because when you search a breed, around 100 images show up, I decided to use the first that shows up for each breed. So I showed the first image that comes up in an arraythis way, you can generate a random dog, or one that you search the biggest issue with this is you have to specifically type in the breed by the way the website
also had some issues with some of the API pictures not loading, couldn't figure out how to fix it on my end -->
